      <h3>Diwali Pooja</h3>
                <a href="images/diwali2.jpg" data-lightbox='vecta' data-title=" diwali"><img src="images/diwali2.jpg"></a>
          A Diwali pooja is worship to the Deities of the Hindu 
      Religion in the form of prayer, offerings and sacrifices. The day of 
      Diwali is important since it signifies the worship and praise of devotees 
      to the various deities; but most importantly, it is a day of praise to
      <strong>Goddess Lakshmi</strong> and by extension the divine mother of the 
      entire universe and the earthly (physical) mother. Most devout Hindus 
      perform the Dipavali Pooja in a fixed, ritualistic pattern, by celebrating 
      in praise and offerings to <strong>Lord Ganesh, Lord Shiva, The Nine 
      Planets, Kalsa (representing the Universe) and Mother Lakshmi</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      During the Dipavali Poojan, offerings are made to the fire (Agni devta), 
      which is viewed as the mouth of the Divine- it is the actual feeding of 
      the God. During Diwali Pooja, sixteen prescribed steps occur (symbolic of 
      the sixteen ceremonies to be completed in the life span of a Hindu) 
      including the welcoming of the Deity, giving the Deity a place to sit, the 
      washing of the feet, decorating the Deity, and the offering of food items, 
      clothing or money to seek blessings. <br>
      <br>
      Fresh, sweet-scented flowers along with specific herbs and plants are 
      used, as well as <strong>Jhal/Phaag</strong> (a combination of milk, ghee, 
      honey and spices). The planting of flags with significant colors 
      associated with the deities is used to symbolize the offerings. In 
      addition, this particular Pooja not only celebrates happiness with light, 
      but with song, chanting, tasting of food, ringing of bells, and the 
      blowing of Conch shells as blessings are bestowed among family members.
      <br>
      <br>
      Tiny lamps of clay are lighted to drive away the shadows of evil spirits 
      and <strong>Self-enlightenment</strong> is expressed. It is believed that 
      on this day Lakshmi visits each household and showers her blessings on man 
      for plenty and prosperity. Once the ceremonial worship is finished in the 
      evening, sweets are offered to the goddess as &quot;Naivedya&quot; and distributed 
      as <strong>&quot;Prasad&quot;</strong>. Feasts are arranged and gifts are exchanged 
      on this day. Gaily dressed men, women and children go to temples and 
      fairs, visit friends and relatives. <br>
      <br>
      One of the most curious customs, which characterizes this festival of 
      Dipavali, is the indulgence of gambling, especially on a large scale in 
      North India. It is believed that <strong>Goddess Parvati</strong> played 
      dice with her husband, <strong>Lord Shiva</strong> on this day and she 
      decreed that whosoever gambled on Diwali night would prosper throughout 
      the ensuring year. This tradition of playing cards- flush and rummy with 
      stakes on this particular day continues even to day.
   <h3>Diwali Meaning &amp; Significance</h3>
               <a href="images/lamp.jpg" data-lightbox='vecta' data-title=" lamp"><img src="images/lamp.jpg"></a>

                Deepavali is a festival where people from all age groups participate. 
        They give expression to their happiness by lighting earthen 'diyas' 
        (lamps), decorating the houses, bursting firecrackers and inviting near 
        and dear ones to their households for partaking in a sumptuous feast. 
        The lighting of lamps is a way of paying obeisance to god for attainment 
        of health, wealth, knowledge, peace, valor and fame. <br>
        <br>
        It is one time in the whole year that children volunteer to leave their 
        beds long before the day begins. In fact, the traditional oil bath at 3 
        a.m, is the only chore that stands between them and the pre-dawn 
        adventures. They emerge, scrubbed clean to get into their festive 
        attire, and light up little oil lamps, candles and scented 
        sticks(agarbathis), the wherewithal for setting alight crackers and 
        sparklers. <br>
        <br>
        On Diwali night, little clay lamps are lit in Hindus homes, but now a 
        days colored electric lamps are also used. What is the significance of 
        lighting a lamp? There is a logical answer to this question. It is 
        through the light that the beauty of this world is revealed or 
        experienced. Most civilizations of the world recognize the importance of 
        light as a gift of God. It has always been a symbol of whatever is 
        positive in our world of experience. <br>
        To Hindus, darkness represents ignorance, and light is a metaphor for 
        knowledge. Therefore, lighting a lamp symbolizes the destruction, 
        through knowledge, of all negative forces- wickedness, violence, lust, 
        anger, envy, greed, bigotry, fear, injustice, oppression and suffering, 
        etc. Competition is stiff, and even the little girl in silk frocks and 
        their finery are watching out for the best sparklers and flowerpots, the 
        rockets and Vishnuchakras, which light-up the night sky like a thousand 
        stars. Grown-ups are the soul of generosity. Festive bonhomie abounds.

          <h3>MAKING OF RANGOLI DESIGNS</h3>
            During Diwali, Goddess Lakshmi is believed to visit homes that are 
            well lit, so families decorate their homes. People wear their best 
            clothes or buy new ones, children are given presents and new year 
            greetings are exchanged through visits or Diwali cards. Thus, a 
            Rangoli design is created on doorsteps to welcome everybody. Rangoli 
            exudes a pattern in color that are specific for each region. <br>
            <br>
            During Diwali, in the art of floor painting, the central rangoli 
            design is the symbolic one denoting the deity or the theme. Motifs 
            generally created are lotus, fish, birds, snakes etc. which reflects 
            the unity of man and beast. Most of the rangoli designs are circular 
            exuding a sense of endlessness of time. Celestial symbols such as 
            the sun, moon and other zodiac signs are also common themes for 
            rangoli. Layered with symbolism is the lotus denoting <strong>
            Goddess Lakshmi, the unfolding of life, the heart or the wheel</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            During Diwali, two interfaced triangles are created that indicates 
            the deity of learning, Sarswati. Encircling this is a 24-petal lotus 
            flower border, the outer circle being decorated with Lakshmi's 
            footprints repeated in four corners. Sometimes the lotus petals are 
            made in a triangular shape for variety. In north Bihar, Lakshmi's 
            feet are drawn at the door, the toes pointing inwards to indicate 
            her entrance. <br>
            <br>
            Again in Andhra Pradesh there is an <strong>eight-petal lotus (ashtadal 
            kamal)</strong> and many geometric patterns forming the lotus. In 
            Tamil Nadu the <strong>hridaya kamalam</strong> is an eight-pointed 
            star meaning lotus of the heart. In Maharasthra too the lotus is a 
            basic motif and designs like <strong>shankh kamal - shell lotus</strong> 
            and <strong>thabak</strong> which means salver is in the shape of an 
            eight-petal lotus with straight lines elaborated with curving lines 
            to give it the appearance of a salver. In Gujarat alone there are 
            said to be 1001 variations of the lotus which are drawn during 
            Diwali, the festival when Goddess Lakshmi is worshiped. Other motifs 
            are swastikas and conch shells. <br>
            <br>
            All over the southern part of India the Diwali festival is marked by 
            gaiety and prosperity. The rangolis drawn are peripheral. Most 
            Rangolis are basically geometric patterns formed with dots and lines 
            to make <strong>squares, circles, swastikas, lotus, trident, fish, 
            conch shell footprints, creepers, trees</strong> bear testimony both 
            to individual genius and community participation and many work for 
            days together on single design. <br>
            <br>
            The raw materials mainly used to make rangoli are edibles like rice 
            flour, pulse and leaves. All over India, floor paintings are 
            essentially white in color. White is a symbol of peace, purity and 
            tranquility. The material used is rice flour or rice paste, because 
            rice to all Indians is a sign of prosperity. Yet another symbol of 
            prosperity is the color yellow. Turmeric yellow or ocher is also 
            often used to fill in the white outlines. More often however, 
            vermilion is used. <strong>Vermilion</strong>, is considered 
            auspicious. Also used are pea green and rust brown.<br>
<h3>Fortunate 
      is the one who has learned to Admire, but not to envy. Good wishes for a 
      joyous Diwali with a plenty of peace and prosperity.
      The 
      happiest of wishes for a Deepawali, that will be happy in every way for 
      someone like you.</h3>
