            <h3>Festivals 
      In India</h3>
      <p><strong>INDIAN FESTIVALS</strong> celebrated by varied cultures and through their special rituals add to the colours of Indian heritage. Some festivals 
      welcome the seasons of the year, the harvest, the rains, or the full moon. Others celebrate religious 
      occasions, the birthdays of divine beings, saints, and gurus (revered 
      teachers), or the advent of the New Year. A number of these festivals are 
      common to most parts of India. However, they may be called by different 
      names in various parts of the country or may be celebrated in a different 
      fashion.</p>
      <p>
      Many festivals celebrate the various harvests; commemorate great 
      historical figures and events, while many express devotion to the deities 
      of different religions.</p>
      <p>
      Every celebration centres around the rituals of prayer, seeking blessings, 
      exchanging goodwill, decorating houses, wearing new cloths, music, dance 
      and feasting.</p>
      <p>
      In India every region and every religion has something to celebrate. The 
      festivals reflect the vigour and life-style of its people. Vibrant colours, 
      music and festivity make the country come alive throughout the year.</p>
      <p>
      The emphasis laid on the different festivals differs in different parts of 
      the country. For instance, Navaratri is celebrated with maximum fervour in 
      West Bengal as compared to that in other parts of the country. Holi is 
      celebrated with gusto in the north, and although it is also observed in 
      the western and eastern parts of India, in the south it is almost unknown. 
      There are also a few regional festivals and the various other temple festivals devoted to the specific 
      patron Gods and Goddesses of the temples, which are celebrated exclusively 
      in those areas, which may be limited to one or a few villages. This galaxy 
      of festivals that exist do contribute in inter-spicing Indian life with 
      gaiety and colour as also in giving the country the distinction of having 
      the maximum number of holidays. </p>
      <p>The portal for Festivals of India,
      www.festivalsinindia.in, is the stage drafted to endow the browser 
      with rituals, traditions, legends held behind different festivals, 
      providing an interactive media to seek the suggestions, guidance 
      and knowledge of our viewers. The portal has a month-wise listing of 
      different festivals celebrated throughout India with great enthusiasm, 
      from January to December schedule of all the festivals.</p>
      <p>
      VaNik Corporation Pvt. Ltd. has taken the initiative to 
      provide www.festivalsinindia.in as one interactive platform that 
      could open the door to the vivid festivals of India, providing the 
      detailed information regarding the rituals, traditions and legends of the 
      festivals.</p>
